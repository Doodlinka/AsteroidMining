## Summary
A top-down arcade shooter where you have to shoot rocks to break them and collect the small pieces with a grappling beam to get score. We intended to make this more different from Asteroids, but hadn't the time. We hope it's different enough to not violate the IP rule.

Note that the game doesn't restart on its own, so you'll have to close it or update the page.
## Controls:
